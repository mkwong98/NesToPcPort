Porting NES game to PC. 

To compile the game of your choice, replace the two files game.h and gameCode.cpp with the one in the game folder.

The game code is converted using NesRomAnalyzer. Data and graphics are taken from the ROM. Before running the program, first run NesPortConfig.exe in the Configurator folder to create a config file. A copy of the ROM and a palette file are required. See https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_palettes for more info on palette files.
